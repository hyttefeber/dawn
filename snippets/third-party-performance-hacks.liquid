This snip is intended to help us keep track of which assets we remove from the Shopify header and host natively instead.

Use very specific logic to ensure the assets only gets loaded where needed. 


Plan:
*Get all the mostly static CSS merged and self hosted (GDPR bar, reviews.io, fonts, individual rebuy styles if any)
*Load less fonts - use the ones we have where possible, and remove the others
*More to come
